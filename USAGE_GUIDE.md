## 🧠 Memory Bank Integration

### What it Contains
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Domain, Service, Selector, Unit of Work patterns from fflib-apex-common
- **LWC Best Practices**: Component structure, data access (@wire vs imperative), error handling, communication patterns
- **Security Guidelines**: USER_MODE/SYSTEM_MODE, field-level security, CSP compliance
- **Advanced Testing Framework**: **Comprehensive ApexMocks patterns, test data factories, 5x faster execution**
- **Performance Optimization**: Governor limits, bulkification, component lifecycle management

### Integration with Cursor
1. **Copy `memory.md` to your project root**
2. **Reference in AI prompts**: "@memory.md" to include knowledge in context
3. **Use for code reviews**: Ask AI to validate code against patterns in memory bank

## 🔧 Rules Engine Setup

### Automated Code Quality
The `rules.json` file contains 50+ enforceable rules across:
- **Enterprise Patterns** (7 rules): Domain/Service/Selector compliance
- **Lightning Web Components** (15 rules): Component structure, data patterns, error handling
- **Governor Limits** (2 rules): Bulkification, no SOQL/DML in loops
- **Security** (4 rules): USER_MODE, field-level security, CSP compliance
- **Advanced Testing** (12 rules): **ApexMocks patterns, test data factories, performance testing**
- **Architecture** (10+ rules): Separation of concerns, code organization

### Integration Options
```json
{
  "eslint": {
    "extends": ["@salesforce/eslint-config-lwc"],
    "rules": {
      "lwc/file-structure": "error",
      "lwc/wire-preferred": "warn"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Custom Cursor Mode

### Installation
1. **Copy `salesforce-enterprise-patterns.mode.json` to your project**
2. **In Cursor**: Open Command Palette → "Cursor: Load Custom Mode"
3. **Select the mode file**: Your project now has AI-powered Salesforce development

```

### Code Review and Validation

```
// Review prompts
Review this trigger code against Enterprise Pattern best practices from @memory.md

Validate this LWC component against the rules in @rules.json

Check this Apex class for governor limit compliance and security issues
```

### Generate Comprehensive Test Classes

```
// Test class generation prompts

- ApexMocks unit tests for all validation rules
- Test data factory for consistent test account creation
- Bulk operation testing with 200+ records
- Exception handling for validation failures
- Performance testing with governor limit validation

Create a complete test class for OpportunityService with:
- Mock all dependencies using Application.setMock()
- Test positive and negative scenarios
- Verify service interactions with ApexMocks verify()
- Include integration test for trigger coverage
