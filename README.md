    IAccounts domain = Accounts.newInstance(accounts);
    
    domain.validateCreditRating();
    
    // Verify business logic executed correctly
    System.assertEquals('A', accounts[0].Credit_Rating__c);
}
```

**Service Class Testing**
```apex
@IsTest
static void processAccountsSuccessTest() {
    // Mock all dependencies
    fflib_ApexMocks mocks = new fflib_ApexMocks();
    IAccountsSelector mockSelector = (IAccountsSelector) mocks.mock(IAccountsSelector.class);
    
    // Execute with mocked dependencies
    Application.Selector.setMock(mockSelector);
    AccountService.processAccounts(accountIds);
    
    // Verify interactions
    ((IAccountsSelector) mocks.verify(mockSelector, 1)).selectById(accountIds);
}
```
